# Module 5 | PyBer Analysis

## Project Overview
Create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Using Pandas and Matplotlib, create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Resources
Resources/city_data.csv

Resources/ride_data.csv

## Summary / Results
Though the quanity of Urban rides are higher the cost per fare is greater in Rural areas.

## Challenge Overview
Analyze and visualize ride-sharing data using Python, Pandas, and the Matplotlib library.

The line chart for this challenge isn't correct so I haven't posted one yet. I hope to have it fixed before grading.

## Challenge Summary
Syntax is everything in Python, the more you use it the more you know. Practice is crucial to our success; eventually the analysis will get easier and I won't step into as many holes along the way. LOL
