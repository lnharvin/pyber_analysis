# Module 5 | PyBer Analysis

## Project Overview
Create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Using Pandas and Matplotlib, create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

Deliverables:
 1. A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type
 2. A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type
 3. A written report for the PyBer analysis

## Summary / Results
The following chart displays the total number of rides, total number of drivers, and the total fares for each city type. The average fare per ride and average fare per driver for each city type is included as well.

Though the quanity of Urban rides are higher, the cost per fare is greater in Rural areas.

Using the Pandas functions, pivot() and resample(), below displays a multiple-line graph that shows the total fares for each week by city type from January - April 2019.

The last week in February appears to be very active across all three city types.

## Challenge Overview
Analyze and visualize ride-sharing data using Python, Pandas, and the Matplotlib library.

I ran into some difficulties running charting packages in python on a machine using Windows 11. Once I moved all my code, programs and packages to a machine running Windows 10 everything worked as expected. 

## Challenge Summary
Syntax is everything in Python, the more you use it the more you know. Practice is crucial to our success; eventually the analysis will get easier and I won't step into as many holes along the way. LOL
